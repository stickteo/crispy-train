# project-euler

My solutions to Project Euler problems. Beware that you can not unsee solutions. In most problems, I attempt to optimize the solution as much as possible. My coding style mainly stems from thinking of the simplest possible implementation. Trying to use the simplest data structure for the implementation and not unnecessarily complicate the solution.
